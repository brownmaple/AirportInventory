1. while moving to real framework from POC, we need to have attributes to hold the details of objects.
Because going formward if we wish to have new parameters for objects, it will result in adding new columns and that will be a structural change in the tables

2. So for the third table (material_worker), material ID can be the primary key, because one material can be owned by one worker
only. But what if W1 wants to hold the material for half day and W2 wants to hold the material for half day.
